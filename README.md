HeaderDiff Demo
===============

[HeaderDiff](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ruellan-headerdiff-00) is a proposal for efficiently representing HTTP headers in the context of HTTP/2.0.

This [demo](http://hruellan.github.io/headerdiff-js/headerDiffDemo.html) is an implementation of the proposal using JavaScript. It allows testing the encoding of different sets of headers, showing how the different algorithms work.
